So, time for an update.

I was working with the [CCExtractor] org for some time. I was recommended this organisation by a friend and they do
some very nice work. They specalize in tools that help extract subtitles out of video files. 
It is a pretty sweet tool, if I say so myself.

My project is a bit on the tangent from their core work. I will be working on [Project Nephos]. Red Hen, a sister organisation
to CCExtractor is involved in downloading local TV channels and archiving them. They use this data for a lot of research purposes.
My job is to build a tool to automate this lifecycle; from downloading the data to uploading them to the cloud and everything in
between.

I am partnered with another great guy on this project and I hope this turns out to be a great success. I will be posting
regular updates here, so stay tuned. You can also follow the code directly from the github [repo]
