Another two weeks, another update. Things are getting exciting.

1. Finished coding up most of the basic functionality. Only adding permissions remain.
1. Added a few basic tests for the said functionality. This is because their structure is not
final and can change. No point rewriting tests everytime you change the code a bit.
1. Added internal documentation for the said code.
1. Imported the old recorder from the CCExtractor git. 
1. Added an init functionality so that the project can be initialized and other background process
can be started.
1. Improved configuration handling.
1. Added some basic docs for the script.

My target for the next week is actually to complete the non recording stuff. That includes stuff like
automation and feature completeness. I will also be interacting with my teammates for ideas on automation.
